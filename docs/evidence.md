# Evidence: Anthropic's pattern of opaque limit changes

## Incident 1: Christmas 2x promo → post-holiday nerf (Dec 25, 2025 – Jan 5, 2026)

Anthropic ran a 2x usage promotion from December 25 at 00:00 UTC through December 31, covering Pro and Max subscribers across claude.ai, Claude Code, and Claude in Chrome.

When it expired, limits felt tighter than pre-promotion baseline. A Claude Code user provided The Register with screenshots showing roughly 60% reduction in token usage limits based on token-level analysis of Claude Code logs. Anthropic's response: users are "reacting to the withdrawal of bonus usage awarded over the holidays."

A Max plan subscriber who'd rarely hit limits filed a GitHub bug report on January 4 — hitting rate limits within an hour of normal usage since January 1st, theorizing limits reverted to a tighter fall baseline rather than the pre-promotion level.

On forums, Reddit, and the Claude Developers Discord, developers reported token consumption suddenly increasing, with accounts reaching maximum within minutes or hours on tasks that previously worked fine.

## Incident 2: March 2x off-peak promo → simultaneous silent nerf (Mar 13–28, 2026)

From March 13 through March 28, five-hour usage was doubled during off-peak hours (outside 8 AM–2 PM ET on weekdays). Framed as a thank-you for growth after a competitor boycott drove Claude to #1 on the App Store.

During the same promotional period, Anthropic silently tightened peak-hour session limits. Reports started around March 23, with a $200 Max subscriber posting screenshots showing session usage climbing from 52% to 68% to 91% within minutes of a five-hour window.

The explanation came days later — not as a blog post, but a tweet thread from Thariq, one engineer. About 7% of users would now hit limits they wouldn't have before. Pro subscribers most affected.

## The pattern

Same structure both times:

1. Announce generous temporary promotion
2. Silently tighten baseline limits during or immediately after the promotion window
3. Attribute complaints to "contrast effect" or "return to normal"

Meanwhile: Anthropic does not publish token budgets, does not version cap announcements, and does not provide a changelog when limits change. The usage API reports percentages at 1% granularity — a percentage of an undisclosed number.

## Why this matters

This isn't about the limits being too low. It's about the opacity.

If you're paying $200/month for Max 20x, you should be able to answer: "20x what?" Anthropic doesn't say. The only way to find out is to measure it yourself — which is what ccmeter does.
